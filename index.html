            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Charles Haddon Spurgeon life:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>19 June 1834</strong> - Born in Kelvedon, England</li>
              <li>
                <strong>April 1854</strong> -  after preaching three months on probation and just four years after his conversion, Spurgeon, then only 19 years old, was called to the pastorate of London's famed New Park Street Chapel in Southwark (formerly pastored by the Particular Baptists Benjamin Keach, and theologian John Gill)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>8 January 1856</strong> - Spurgeon married Susannah, daughter of Robert Thompson of Falcon Square, London, by whom he had twin sons, Charles and Thomas born on September 20, 1856. At the end of that year, tragedy struck on 19 October 1856, as Spurgeon was preaching at the Surrey Gardens Music Hall for the first time. Someone in the crowd yelled, "FIRE". The ensuing panic and stampede left several dead. Spurgeon was emotionally impacted by the event and it had a sobering influence on his life. For many years he spoke of being moved to tears for no reason known to himself.
                scars on me."
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>18 March 1861</strong> -  the congregation moved permanently to the newly constructed purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle, Southwark, seating 5,000 people with standing room for another 1,000. The Metropolitan Tabernacle was the largest church edifice of its day. Spurgeon continued to preach there several times per week until his death 31 years later. He never gave altar calls at the conclusion of his sermons, but he always extended the invitation that if anyone was moved to seek an interest in Christ by his preaching on a Sunday, they could meet with him at his vestry on Monday morning. Without fail, there was always someone at his door the next day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>5 June 1862</strong> - Spurgeon challenged the Church of England when he preached against baptismal regeneration.[14] However, Spurgeon taught across denominational lines as well: for example, in 1877 he was the preacher at the opening of a new Free Church of Scotland church building in Dingwall. It was during this period at the new Tabernacle that Spurgeon found a friend in James Hudson Taylor, the founder of the inter-denominational China Inland Mission. Spurgeon supported the work of the mission financially and directed many missionary candidates to apply for service with Taylor. He also aided in the work of cross-cultural evangelism by promoting "The Wordless Book", a teaching tool that he described in a message given on 11 January 1866, regarding Psalm 51:7: "Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow." The book has been and is still used to teach people without reading skills and people of other cultures and languages – young and old – around the globe about the Gospel message
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1876</strong> - 22 years after becoming pastor, Spurgeon published "The Metropolitan Tabernacle: Its History and Work".[19] His intention stated in the preface is to give a 'printed history of the Tabernacle'. The book has 15 chapters and of these 5 are given over to what he called 'Societies and Institutions'.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>1887 </strong> -A controversy among the Baptists flared in 1887 with Spurgeon's first "Down-grade" article, published in The Sword & the Trowel.[36] In the ensuing "Downgrade Controversy," the Metropolitan Tabernacle disaffiliated from the Baptist Union, effectuating Spurgeon's congregation as the world's largest self-standing church. Spurgeon framed the controversy in this way:

                Believers in Christ's atonement are now in declared union with those who make light of it; believers in Holy Scripture are in confederacy with those who deny plenary inspiration; those who hold evangelical doctrine are in open alliance with those who call the fall a fable, who deny the personality of the Holy Ghost, who call justification by faith immoral, and hold that there is another probation after death… It is our solemn conviction that there should be no pretence of fellowship. Fellowship with known and vital error is participation in sin.[37]
                
                The controversy took its name from Spurgeon's use of the term "Downgrade" to describe certain other Baptists' outlook toward the Bible (i.e., they had "downgraded" the Bible and the principle of sola scriptura).[38] Spurgeon alleged that an incremental creeping of the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, and other concepts were weakening the Baptist Union.[39][40][41] Spurgeon emphatically decried the doctrine that resulted:
                
                Assuredly the New Theology can do no good towards God or man; it, has no adaptation for it. If it were preached for a thousand years by all the most earnest men of the school, it would never renew a soul, nor overcome pride in a single human heart.[42]
                
                The standoff caused division amongst the Baptists and other non-conformists and is regarded by many as an important paradigm.[a][39][43][44]
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>May 1891</strong> - He became increasingly unwell and in May 1891 he was forced 'to rest'. In 1891 he went to rest in Menton and remained there for three months. During this period he wrote 180 pages of commentary.[61] However, he did not recover and died at the age of 57, while still in Menton, from gout and congestion of the kidneys.[62] From May 1891 until his death in January 1892, he received 10,000 letters of 'condolence, resolutions of sympathy, telegrams of enquiry'.[61]

              <li>
                <strong>31 January 1892</strong> - Date Of his Death
              </li>
                 
            </ul>
           
              <p>
                Spurgeon was survived by his wife and sons. His remains were buried at West Norwood Cemetery in London, where the tomb is still visited by admirers. His son Tom became the pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle after his father died.
